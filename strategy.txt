This was done step by step as described in the instructions. the program starts by setting all angles used equal to zero. THen making hubo wave hello a few times. The weight is shifted a little to prevent hubo from falling, this is later adjusted when it stands up straight. After that HUBO starts going up and down at a .25HZ. while still waving it's hand. This was achieved by using a cosine function to wave while using a linear realtionship tp bend the knees. HUBO does goes up and down 3 times. Then stops moving its legs, but the the waving while loop is still used for 5 seconds. Then everything is put back to normal.
