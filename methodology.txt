The key frames method was used for this homework assingment. 
The code worked the same way. Each piece was done one at a time. each piece is done in a while loop to make the robot move slower. 
here are the step used to make it walk: 

-Weight (center of mass) was shifted to the right foot
-the left foot was lifted forward
-then the right foot was bent (the ankle from the left foot is -bent during htis process as well) 
-then the weight was shifted to the left foot
-the left foot was straightened (to bring the robot forward)
-the right fooot was lifted then straightened, and the same process as above was repeated for this leg.
